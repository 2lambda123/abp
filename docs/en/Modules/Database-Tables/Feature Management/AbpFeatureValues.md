## AbpFeatureValues

AbpFeatureValues is used to store feature values for providers.

### Description

This table stores the values of the features for different providers. Each record in the table represents a feature value and allows to manage the application features values effectively. For example, you can use the `Name` column to link each feature value with its corresponding feature in the [`AbpFeatures`](AbpFeatures.md) table, so that you can easily manage and organize the features.

### Module

[`Volo.Abp.FeatureManagement`](../../Feature-Management.md)
