## AbpRoleClaims

AbpRoleClaims is used to store role claims.

### Description

This table stores information about the claims assigned to roles in the application. Each record in the table represents a claim assigned to a role and allows to manage and track the claims effectively. This table is useful for managing role-based access control by allowing to assign claims to roles, which describe the access rights of the users that belong to that role.
