## AbpFeatureGroups

AbpFeatureGroups is used to store feature groups.
### Description

This table stores information about the feature groups in the application. Each record in the table represents a feature group and allows to manage and organize the features effectively. For example, you can use the `GroupName` column to link each feature with its corresponding group in the [`AbpFeatureGroups`](AbpFeatureGroups.md) table, so that you can easily manage and organize the features.
